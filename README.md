# TuringCNC
A Turing machine style CNC g-code file

A cool proof-of-concept for a multi-menu style control switcher system for a multi-segmented CNC g-code.
Disclaimer:  I'm not that familiar with actual g-code used by CNC machines but know the control structure.

This in no way is safe for an actual CNC machine unless tested and verified by a qualified machinist.
Therefor, don't crash your machine.  :-)

-- It's just a cool idea.
